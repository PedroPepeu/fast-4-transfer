# To-Do

## Frontend
- Use the buttons added to upload or not the content, if isn't any files, then make it unusable.
- Change the links to the social button on footer, and change the link address.
- Learn how to use rooter in astro.
- Update the drag-and-drop the files, fix the files names, and file max size.
- Write the `about` using `.md` just to talk about the information of the size and how it works, like an *whitepaper*.
- Add an warning below the files, in red, so the user can remember that the files are not 'secures' and 'anyone' can see (Check if there is an way to secure the files)

## Backend
- Create an route to receive data from DAD.
- Send this data to IPFS and get the link to render the other page.
- `go get github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api` connecting backend with ipfs

## DevOps
- Need to fix the IPFS
- Implement backend dockerfile
- Implement frontend dockerfile
- Fix the docker as an whole to make everything running
